Thanks for your letter. It's
always good to hear from you
My favorite kind of films are romantic comedies. I like to laugh and at the same time enjoy watching two people falling in love and going through the life challenges together. Such movies really inspires me and makes me feel good. One of my favorite movies of romance is “Pride and Prejudice”. It’s a beautiful story that happened in England and how a rich man Mr. Darcy falls in love with a simple girl from regular family, and that their love had to go through a lot hard moments, but no matter how much money you have, or your social status, love is completely unconditional. 

I never liked horror movies, because they would make me anxious and would not give any positive emotions. I don’t like to watch a movie and be scared. I don’t like to see guns, killing each other and doing any bad things. Instead, I like to see people’s relationships and funny moments that would make me laugh.
